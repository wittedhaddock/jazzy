*jazzy is a command-line utility that generates documentation for Swift or Objective-C*

## About

Both Swift and Objective-C projects are supported.

*Objective-C support was recently added, so please report any issues you find.*

Instead of parsing your source files, `jazzy` hooks into [Clang][clang] and
[SourceKit][sourcekit] to use the [AST][ast] representation of your code and
its comments for more accurate results. The output matches the look and feel 
of Apple’s official reference documentation, post WWDC 2014.

## Requirements

* A version of [Xcode][xcode] (6.x or 7.x) capable of building the project 
you wish to document. It must be installed in a location indexed by Spotlight.

## Installation

```shell
[sudo] gem install jazzy
```

## Usage

Run `jazzy` from your command line. Run `jazzy -h` for a list of additional options.

You can set options for your project’s documentation in a configuration file,
`.jazzy.yaml` by default. For a detailed explanation and an exhaustive list of
all available options, run `jazzy --help config`.

### Supported keywords

Swift header documentation is written in markdown and supports a number of special keywords.
For a complete list and examples, see Erica Sadun's post on [*Swift header documentation in Xcode 7*](http://ericasadun.com/2015/06/14/swift-header-documentation-in-xcode-7/).

For Objective-C documentation the same keywords are supported, but note that the format
is slightly different. In Swift you would write `- returns:`, but in Objective-C you write `@return`. See Apple's [*HeaderDoc User Guide*](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/HeaderDoc/tags/tags.html) for more details. **Note: `jazzy` currently does not support _all_ Objective-C keywords listed in this document.**

### Swift

Swift documentation is generated by default.

##### Example 

This is how Realm Swift docs are generated:

```shell
jazzy \
  --clean \
  --author Realm \
  --author_url https://realm.io \
  --github_url https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa \
  --github-file-prefix https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/tree/v0.96.2 \
  --module-version 0.96.2 \
  --xcodebuild-arguments -scheme,RealmSwift \
  --module RealmSwift \
  --root-url https://realm.io/docs/swift/0.96.2/api/ \
  --output docs/swift_output \
  --theme docs/themes
```

### Objective-C

To generate documentation for Objective-C headers, you must pass the following
parameters to jazzy:

* `--objc`
* `--umbrella-header ...` 
* `-framework-root ...`
* `--sdk [iphone|watch|appletv][os|simulator]|macosx` (optional, default value
   of `macosx`)

##### Example

This is how Realm Objective-C docs are generated:

```shell
jazzy \
  --objc \
  --clean \
  --author Realm \
  --author_url https://realm.io \
  --github_url https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa \
  --github-file-prefix https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/tree/v0.96.2 \
  --module-version 0.96.2 \
  --umbrella-header Realm/Realm.h \
  --framework-root . \
  --module Realm \
  --root-url https://realm.io/docs/objc/0.96.2/api/ \
  --output docs/objc_output \
  --theme docs/themes
```

This is how the AFNetworking docs are generated:

```shell
jazzy \
  --objc \
  --author AFNetworking \
  --author_url http://afnetworking.com \
  --github_url https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking \
  --github-file-prefix https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/tree/2.6.2 \
  --module-version 2.6.2 \
  --umbrella-header AFNetworking/AFNetworking.h \
  --framework-root . \
  --module AFNetworking
```

### Themes

Two themes are provided with jazzy: `apple` (default) and `fullwidth`.

Here's an example built with `apple`: <https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/api/>

Here's an example built with `fullwidth`: <http://reduxkit.github.io/ReduxKit/>

You can specify which theme to use by passing in the `--` option. You can
also provide your own custom theme by passing in the path to your theme
directory.

## Troubleshooting

#### Swift

**Only extensions are listed in the documentation?**

By default, `jazzy` only documents public declarations. To generate documentation
for declarations with a lower accessibility level (`internal` or `private`), please
set the `--min-acl` flag to `internal` or `private`.

## Development

Please review jazzy's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) when submitting pull requests.

jazzy is composed of two parts: 

1. The parser, [SourceKitten][SourceKitten] (written in Swift)
2. The site generator (written in ruby)

To build and run jazzy from source: 

1. Install [bundler][bundler]. 
2. Run `bundle install` from the root of this repo. 
3. Run jazzy from source by running `bin/jazzy`.

Instructions to build SourceKitten from source can be found at
[SourceKitten's GitHub repository][SourceKitten].

## Design Goals

- Generate source code docs matching Apple's official reference documentation
- Support for standard Objective-C and Swift documentation comment syntax
- Leverage modern HTML templating ([Mustache][mustache])
- Leverage the power and accuracy of the [Clang AST][ast] and [SourceKit][sourcekit]
- Support for Dash docsets
- Support Swift and Objective-C (*mixed projects are a work in progress*)
